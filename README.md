This is a simulation showcase running in [streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

Input parameters are production amounts and sales forecasts. The result is a visual representation of the resulting stock level over the specified time frame.

It is intended for collaborative and interactive decision making in a visual way during a all-hands situation.

The demo is running at <https://shiny-simulation-system.streamlit.app>.
